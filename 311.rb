# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#Create an array to store 5 numbers. Then print out each number on separate lines with a while loop
numbers = [3, 7, 9, 13, 21]
index = 0
while index < numbers.length
    pp numbers[index]
index = index + 1
end
# I am still struggling with this problem. I need to remeber to add index and  square brackets vs round etc.
