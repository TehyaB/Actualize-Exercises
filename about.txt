My name is Tehya Brown and I am origianally from Colorado. I have a BS in Psychology and a background in heathcare and caretaking special needs adults. I recently moved to Texas, and made the decision to move away from my current job field of caregiving and explore something else. My boyfriend Peter introduced me to coding and DevOps and I decided to do some research and find a Boot Camp that I felt was a good fit for me. After a lot of research, I found Actualize and fell in love with the curriculum. I also thought it was a good price point and I loved that there was a daytime cohort as I am a busy mom in the afternoons and weekends. I donâ€™t know much about this field, but I am excited to learn!
