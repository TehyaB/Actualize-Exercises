# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
#Use a variable to store a number,then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

number = 7
if number == 10
    puts 0
else 
    puts -1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I had it right from memory but started overthinking and second guessing the forrmat. 
# So I need more practice with remembering to indent lines of code for better readablity.
