# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#Create an array to store 3 strings with lower case letters. 
#Then change the third string to have all capital letters and print the array on one line

words = ["yes", "yes", "yes"]
words[2] = words[2].upcase
pp words 

# still working on using the correct brackets. tomorrow I plan on returning to arrays.
